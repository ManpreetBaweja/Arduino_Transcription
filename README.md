# Arduino_Transcription
This repo contains the software code for Speech Transcription using Whisper and an Arduino Uno. 

A sound detection sensor triggers the laptop's microphone to record audio for 5 seconds, which is then transcribed by the whisper base model. This transcription is then sent
to the LCD display through the arduino.
